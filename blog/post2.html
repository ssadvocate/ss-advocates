    <p>[[ Filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) is a mandatory annual task for many individuals and businesses in India. It's not just about paying taxes; it's a way to formally declare your income to the Income Tax Department, claim refunds, and carry forward losses. This guide will walk you through the key aspects of ITR filing.

What is an ITR and Who Needs to File It?

An ITR is a form used by taxpayers to report their total income, deductions, and taxes paid during a financial year. The Income Tax Department has several ITR forms (ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, etc.), and you must choose the one that applies to your specific financial situation.

You must file an ITR if you meet any of the following criteria: ]]</p>

    <ol>
      <li>[[ Your total income exceeds the basic exemption limit (which varies based on age and tax regime). ]]</li>
      <li>[[ You are a company or a firm. ]]</li>
      <li>[[ You want to claim a tax refund. ]]</li>
      <li>[[ You want to carry forward a loss to the next financial year. ]]</li>
      <li>[[ You have a financial asset outside India. ]]</li>
      <li>[[You are a resident with signing authority in a foreign account.]]</li>
    </ol>
